## Introduction

As someone who learned Python before C++, one of my biggest complaints was how C++ handled strings. In Python strings were so versatile and were accompanied with a plethora of useful methods. Not so much for std::string in C++. Even though std::string performs fine, and it isn't too hard to manipulate it to my needs, I wanted to undertake this project to create a more Pythonic string class for C++.

It is my hope, that in the coming weeks I will be able to generate a single-header include that will perform similarly to std::string, whilst containing the functionality and methods that Python strings possess.
